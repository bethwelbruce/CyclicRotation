#An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right
# by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example,
# the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and
# 6 is moved to the first place).
#The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
#Write a function:
#def solution(A, K)
#that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
#For example, given
    #A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
     #K = 3
#the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:
   # [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    #[6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    #[7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
#For another example, given
    #A = [0, 0, 0]
    #K = 1
#the function should return [0, 0, 0]
#Given
    #A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    #K = 4
#the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
#Assume that:
#N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
#each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
#In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
